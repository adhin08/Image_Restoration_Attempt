# 🧠 Image Restoration Attempt Through Scattering Media

This project is a minimal replication inspired by the research paper:

**"Resolution imaging through dynamic scattering media"**  
by *Dr. Sujit Kumar Sahoo et al.*, published in *Nature Communications*.

---

## 📌 Objective

To explore how neural networks can restore distorted images after passing through scattering media, using techniques from computational imaging and deep learning.

---

## 🔧 Method Overview

- Used MNIST digits distorted to simulate scattering effects  
- Trained a simple neural network using PyTorch  
- Learned a direct mapping from distorted inputs to clean targets  
- Visualized the restoration results using Google Colab

---

## 🖼️ Sample Output

| Distorted Input | Restored Output | Ground Truth |
|-----------------|------------------|---------------|
| ![input](images/input.png) | ![restored](./images/output.png) | ![target](./images/target.png) |

> _Note: Images are illustrative. Actual output can be found below from the notebook run._

## 🧪 Run the Code

### ▶️ Option 1: Google Colab  
[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1c6MMmoBcL0EjOQC2LMS4laSoruXXlZCl?usp=sharing)  
> Just run the single cell to reproduce the restoration result.

### 🖥️ Option 2: Run Locally (Optional)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/image-restoration-scattering-media.git
cd image-restoration-scattering-media
python image_restoration.py
```
